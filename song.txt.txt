And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill
Be runnin' up that buildin'
Say, if I only could, oh

You don't wanna hurt me (Yeah, yeah, yo)
But see how deep the bullet lies (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Unaware, I'm tearin' you asunder (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Is there so much hate for the ones we love? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Oh, tell me, we both matter, don't we? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
